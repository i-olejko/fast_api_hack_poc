i want to modify the frontend part of my project. 
1. i don't like to use type="submit", instead i would like to use onclick method and inside to call fetch functionality.
1.1 refactor the code from APP.js, and make each page to have its own js file
2. i want to modify the main page and use SPA architecture.
2.1 i want to have navigation bar on the left side with 2 nav items one is called FreeRun and second Console Test
2.2 the both will have moustly the same structure but will call different API's first will utilize the /run_task API and second will use /run_console_task API
2.3 the scond page should also have 2 text field for user input one for the task input and second for the follow up task text.
2.4 the second page should print in a small table the result in the left colum it shuld print the createdName and createdDesc and in right colum it shuld print the foundName name and fondDesc.
3. back-end should have another API with next path  /run_console_task it will call agent_service.run_console method.
3.1 method run_console should accept 2 params strTask and strFollowUpTask and sould return object with next props: createdName, createdDesc, foundName, fondDesc,
3.2 meenwile leeve the run_console method witout actual implementation just add there some mock object to be returned.

Ask me question if i have missed something 



------------------------------------------------------------

plz make next changes.
1. the console test page should also use TaskInput component both in task input and follow-up task.
2. fronend app should have small top bar that will have title on the left displaying "HACK DAY 2025"
2.1 top bar should have theme swithcher drop-down on the right side with only 2 options LIGHT and DARK
2.2 the front end should support theme swithcing mechanism.
2.3 starting position is LIGHT theme


------------------------------------------------------------
plz refactor the frontend code.
currently i have only left nav bar. 
the goal is to add 'TopBar' or 'header' and move title "HACK DAY 2025" and theme swithcher to top bar element.
the navigation items should remain in left side navigation section.

------------------------------------------------------------
plz refactor the ConsoleTestPage:
the page should have 2 text inputs and only one "Run Task" button that will collect text from both inputs and will post them to backend
------------------------------------------------------------
the ConsoleTestPage should have inputs of type textarea
------------------------------------------------------------
