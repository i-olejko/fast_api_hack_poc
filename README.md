# FastAPI + React Python Code Runner (Hackathon PoC)

This project is a proof-of-concept demonstrating a Python FastAPI backend serving a React frontend. The frontend allows users to submit Python code as text, which the backend executes using Python's `exec()` function.

**ðŸš¨ SECURITY WARNING ðŸš¨**
This application uses `exec()` to run arbitrary Python code submitted by the user. **This is extremely dangerous and should NEVER be used in a production environment or any environment where security is a concern.** This PoC is intended solely for demonstration purposes in a controlled hackathon setting.

## Setup

### Automated Setup (Recommended)
Run the setup script to automatically configure the environment:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Manual Setup

1. **Clone/Setup Project:** Ensure you are in the project's root directory.

2. **Backend Setup (Python + FastAPI):**
    *   Create and activate a Python virtual environment (if not already done):
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
        # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        ```
    *   Install Python dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv browser-use playwright langchain-google-genai
        ```
    *   Install Playwright browser:
        ```bash
        playwright install chromium
        ```
    *   Create and configure `.env` file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup (React app in `/frontend` directory):**
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    *   Install Node.js dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Build the React application:
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
    *   Return to the project root directory:
        ```bash
        cd ..
        ```

## Environment Configuration

The `.env` file contains the following configurations:

```env
# API Keys
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# FastAPI Configuration
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8000

# Browser Configuration
BROWSER_HEADLESS=true  # Set to false for visible browser during development
BROWSER_TIMEOUT=30000  # 30 seconds timeout for browser operations

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

Make sure to:
1. Replace `your_google_api_key_here` with your actual Google API key
2. Adjust other configurations as needed for your environment
3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control

## Running the Application

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated (`source venv/bin/activate`).
2.  Start the FastAPI server from the project root directory:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
    ```
    *   `--reload` enables auto-reloading for backend development (optional).
    *   You can also run using `python main.py` if the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is present.
3. To build and start the entire project (frontend and backend) using npm, you can also run:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## Usage

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
2.  You should see the React application interface with a textarea.
3.  Enter Python code (e.g., `print("Hello from exec!")`) into the textarea.
4.  Click the "Run Code" button.
5.  The output (or any execution error) from the backend will be displayed below the form.

**Remember the security warning! Only run code you trust.**
